# WhatsApp Note Extractor

After semester exams, we have lot of images(notes) in our whatsapp folder which are of no use, and manual task of deleting them is tedious. I have trained a CNN model which identifies and places all the notes(images) in a seperate folder.

## How to Use

The model is trained on 1017 images(482 notes and 535 other images). The training file is in model_training directory. 

In order to seperate the images, provide the path of the whatsapp folder in extract.py file and it will seperate notes from other images making your task easy.
